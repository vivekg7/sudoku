# Sudoku

A comprehensive, fully offline Sudoku app that doesn't just let you play — it teaches you how to think. Built with every known solving strategy, a multi-layer hint system, and no tracking, no ads, no internet required.

## Features

- **Smart Puzzle Generation** — Puzzles are generated on the fly across 6 difficulty levels, tuned by the solving strategies required — not just the number of givens.
- **Full Solving Engine** — Implements all known Sudoku solving strategies, from naked singles to forcing chains and ALS.
- **Multi-Layer Hints** — Hints guide your thinking, not hand you answers. From a gentle nudge ("look for 3 in box 4") to a strategy suggestion to the exact answer — you choose how much help you want.
- **Pencil Marks & Undo/Redo** — Full note-taking and move history support.
- **Number-First Input** — Tap a number first, then tap cells to fill — great for placing all instances of a digit quickly.
- **PDF Export** — Generate puzzles in bulk with optional rough work grids, solve-order hints at the back, and QR codes to open each puzzle in the app.
- **QR Scanner** — Scan printed puzzle QR codes to play them interactively.
- **Player Stats** — Track solve times, streaks, completion rates, and detailed hint usage to see which techniques you're mastering.
- **Save & Bookmark** — Save in-progress puzzles, bookmark favourites, and export/import all your data as JSON.
- **CLI App** — A standalone command-line interface with TUI and classic modes.
